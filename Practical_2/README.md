# Practical 2 for lab manual 

1. Input the value of 4 variables a, b, c and d and compute the resultant value of following expressions: 
   (a +b) *(c/d)
   (a +b) * c/d
   a + (b *c) /d
2. Value of 4 variables a, b, c and d  are as a=10, b=15, c=20, d=30,  compute the resultant value of following expressions: a ! = b && ! (a < c) || b >d 
3. Write a program to read an integer input from the user and print the last two digits of that integer.
4. Write a ‘C’ program to take as input 3 floating point numbers. The program then outputs the number with largest magnitude (Largest magnitude number is the largest number obtained after ignoring the sign)
5. Write a program to read two characters and determine if the first character is capital or small form of the second character.
